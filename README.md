How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure the code is functional JUnit tests and coverage testing can be a great way to ensure this. Having code that 100% meets the requirements set forth and means our code is functioning as expected.
For secure code tests devised to test the vulnerabilities in our software can be implemented to catch bugs that can be exploited by hackers. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When creating a program, I take a check list approach to make sure I implement the user needs into my project. Using this strategy, I incorporate the most important needs and go from there. My goal is to make a program that has the best user experience by giving the user what they want.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is to break down my requirements piece by piece. This allows me to code and test each section to ensure the software is preforming as expected.
